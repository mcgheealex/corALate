# 2D_ALDIC 
AL-DIC(Augmented Lagrangian DIC) is a fast, parallel-computing hybrid DIC algorithm, which combines advantages of local subset DIC method (fast computation speed, and parallel computing) and finite-element-based global DIC method (guarantee global kinematic compatibility and decrease noise).  

## Advantages of AL-DIC algorithm
* [1] Itâ€™s a fast algorithm using distributed parallel computing.  
* [2] Global kinematic compatibility is added as a global constraint in the form of augmented Lagrangian, and solved using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers scheme.
* [3] Both displacement fields and affine deformation gradients are correlated at the same time.
* [4] No need of much manual experience about choosing displacement smoothing filters.
* [5] It works well with compressed DIC images and adaptive mesh. See our paper: Yang, J. & Bhattacharya, K. Exp Mech (2019). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11340-018-00459-y;
* [6] Both accumulative and incremental DIC modes are implemented to deal with image sequences, which is especially quite useful for very large deformations.

## Prerequisites & Installation
AL-DIC MATLAB code was tested on MATLAB versions later than R2018a. Both single thread and parallel computing features are included in AL-DIC code. Please download and unzip the code to the MATLAB working path. Then, execute the mail file main_ALDIC.m.
