# Augmented Lagrangian Digital Image Correlation (2D_ALDIC)
AL-DIC(Augmented Lagrangian DIC) is a fast, parallel-computing hybrid DIC algorithm, which combines advantages of local subset DIC method (fast computation speed, and parallel computing) and finite-element-based global DIC method (guarantee global kinematic compatibility and decrease noise).  

Welcome to give the ALDIC code ratings and comments in the MATLAB File Exchange community: [![View Augmented Lagrangian Digital Image Correlation and Tracking on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/70499-augmented-lagrangian-digital-image-correlation-and-tracking)

## Advantages of AL-DIC algorithm
* [1] Itâ€™s a fast algorithm using distributed parallel computing.  
* [2]	Global kinematic compatibility is added as a global constraint in the form of augmented Lagrangian, and solved using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers scheme.
* [3]	Both displacement fields and affine deformation gradients are correlated at the same time.
* [4]	No need of much manual experience about choosing displacement smoothing filters.
* [5]	It works well with compressed DIC images and adaptive mesh. See our paper: Yang, J. & Bhattacharya, K. Exp Mech (2019). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11340-018-00459-y;
* [6]	Both accumulative and incremental DIC modes are implemented to deal with image sequences, which is especially quite useful for very large deformations. 
* [7]	ALDIC application example -- uniaxial compression experiment:

* [8]	ALDIC is extended with adaptive quadtree mesh to solve complex geometry. Some examples: https://uwmadison.box.com/s/4n5hmf04rzp4la96bt2rcjk4f6o5d5nf

## Prerequisites & Installation
AL-DIC MATLAB code was tested on MATLAB versions later than R2018a. Both single thread and parallel computing features are included in AL-DIC code. Please download and unzip the code to the MATLAB working path. Then, execute the mail file: main_ALDIC.m.
